# STA-215 Final Project

This is my replication package for my STA-215 final project. My group and I took down information about the top 200 songs from 2000 to 2024\. Despite the multitude of variables taken as a group, I decided to focus on six in particular: speed, simplicity, monthly listeners, merch sold, and lyrical tone on the ranges of positive to negative and hyper to calm. The overall goal of my analysis was to determine what makes a song one of the most popular songs of the millennium. 

## Instructions 

To utilize the script, open the “lomonaco-finalproject.R” file (this has the script). In order for the script to work, ensure that you have also opened the “Data.csv” file. 

## Data

The data collected for this project is based off of a list of the top 200 songs from 2000-2024 provided by chart2000.com that can be found with [this link](https://chart2000.com/songs.htm). I analyzed the speed of those songs (measuring in bpm), the simplicity of the meanings within those songs, the monthly listeners of the artists who made the songs, the amount of merchandise sold by those artists, and the tone of the lyrics that comprise that song. This was all in an effort to unlock the secrets to song making that makes for a song to be massively popular. 

## Operationalization

Speed was operationalized by using the website tunebat to find the bpm, monthly listeners were determined by searching on Spotify, and merchandise sold was determined by searching on each artist’s merchandise website. 

Simplicity was operationalized by creating 3 categories: Simple, Moderate, and Complicated. Then my groupmate analyzed the songs to sort their messages into those categories. Simple messages were generally defined as not having much nuance and being blatant in the song. Moderate messages were defined as having slight nuance and needing interpretation from the audience to be determined from the song. Complicated messages were defined as being nuanced and requiring more information than provided by the song to be understood properly. 

Both lyrical tone variables were operationalized by providing adjectives to the integers of a 1-10 scale of negativity to positivity and calmness to hyperness. Then, I personally looked over the lyrics of every song and sorted them into their proper category defined by the integer and thus the adjective.
