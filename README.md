# STA215-Final-Project
This is my replication package for my STA-215 final project. My group took down data about the top 200 songs from 2000 to 2024.I focused on six variables: speed, simplicity, monthly listeners, merch sold, and lyrical tone on the ranges of positive to negative and hyper to calm. The goal of my analysis was to determine what makes a song popular.
